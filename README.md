# PrismPHP

**PrismPHP** is a modular, extensible PHP 8 micro-framework that provides a lightweight core (Kernel, DI, HTTP, routing, middleware) and lets you easily plug in bundles. It also lets you maximize performance via specialized C++ components.

> **Note**  
> This project is intended for development purposes only. While I aim to make it production-ready, it remains above all an educational framework built by a single developer.
